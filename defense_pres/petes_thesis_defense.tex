\item $N_\mathrm{reference}$ is the number of jets in a reference sample.
\item $N_\mathrm{triggered,inc}$ is the number of jets from events in reference sample that meet the trigger condition. \item Binning $N_\mathrm{triggered,inc}$ and $N_\mathrm{reference}$ in \pt~ allows the efficiency to be described as a function of \pt.

\item Triggers are used to select events above their ``plateau point''. Sum bins of $N_\mathrm{triggered,inc}$ and $N_\mathrm{reference}$ and take the ratio. The plateau point is where this ratio drops below 99\%, such that trigger is at least 99\% efficient above this point.

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Transition Bin Cross-Section}
\begin{itemize}
\item When a single trigger is used, Jet cross-section is given by
\begin{equation*}
\sigma = N_{jets}\left(\sum_i\frac{\intL_i}{S_i}\right)^{-1},
\end{equation*}
where the sum runs over LumiBlocks, $\intL_i$ is the integrated luminosity and $S_i$ is the trigger prescale.

\item When using the OR of the triggers, events are divided into three classes: those which meet the forward trigger condition (10), the central trigger condition (01), and both trigger conditions (11). The jet cross-section is then
\begin{equation}
\sigma =  \frac{N_\mathrm{01}}{\intL_\mathrm{01}} + \frac{N_\mathrm{10}}{\intL_\mathrm{10}} +\frac{N_\mathrm{11}}{\intL_\mathrm{11}}
\end{equation}
where $N_{xx}$ is the number of jets counted from events of that type, and
%\begin{eqnarray*}
%\intL_\mathrm{01} &=& \sum_i\frac{\intL_i}{S_{i\mathrm{,01}}}\\
%\intL_\mathrm{10} &=& \sum_i\frac{\intL_i}{S_{i\mathrm{,10}}}\\
%\intL_\mathrm{11} &=& \sum_i\frac{\intL_i \left(S_{i\mathrm{,01}} + S_{i\mathrm{,10}} - 1\right) }{ S_{i\mathrm{,01}} \, S_{i\mathrm{,10}}}
%\end{eqnarray*}
\begin{equation*}
%\intL_\mathrm{01} =\sum_i\frac{\intL_i}{S_{i\mathrm{,01}}} ,\quad \intL_\mathrm{10} = \sum_i\frac{\intL_i}{S_{i\mathrm{,10}}}, \quad 
\intL_\mathrm{11} = \sum_i\frac{\intL_i \left(S_{i\mathrm{,01}} + S_{i\mathrm{,10}} - 1\right) }{ S_{i\mathrm{,01}} \, S_{i\mathrm{,10}}} .

%\begin{frame}\frametitle{Unfolding}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Jet energies are measured with finite resolution. Jet spectrum falls sharply with \pt, so more low \pt~jets are measured to have high \pt~than high \pt~jets are measured to have low \pt. Measured spectrum is skewed towards high \pt.
%\item Unfolding is used to correct this effect, based on Monte Carlo. ``Truth'' jets are fromed from the particles output by the event generator. The interaction of these jets with the detector is then simulated (\geant), and ``reconstructed'' are obtained using the same methods as for data. Detector effects can then be inferred by matching truth jets to reconstructed jets and forming a ``Transfer Matrix''.
%\item Transfer matrix can then be inverted and applied to measured jet spectrum to obtain a corrected spectrum. This is not a trivial task, the Iterative, Dynamically Stabilised (IDS) method is used.

%\section{Summary}
\begin{frame}\frametitle{Summary}
\begin{itemize}
\item Data from 2003 beam test of ATLAS forward calorimeter has been analysed, and compared to results obtained from Monte Carlo. The simulation agrees well with the data, and effects associated with additional upstream material are well modelled, providing validation of the simulation.  %\alert{focus on this when discussing TB results earlier}
\item Inclusive Jet and Dijet (backup) cross-sections have been measured using 37 $\mathrm{pb}^{-1}$ of data collected in 2010. These measurements cover a large kinematic region, coherently probing rapidity region that has not previously been studied at a hadron-hadron collider. Cross-section measurements at CMS use two seperate analyses (different jet definitions) to study jets in the central and forward regions, and there is a gap in the rapidity coverage spanned by these analyses.

\item Partons collinearly radiate before (after) hard scatter - initial (final) state radiation.
\item Soft scatterings can occur between partons not involved in the hard scatter (Multiple parton interactions - Underlying Event)
\item Pile-up
\begin{itemize}
\item At design specifications, \atlas expects $\sim$ 23 proton-proton collisions per bunch crossing (only $\sim 3-4$ during 2010).
\item An event containing a hard scattering will also contain several soft scatterings between other protons.
\item This additional pile-up energy is corrected for in the EM+JES calibration.
