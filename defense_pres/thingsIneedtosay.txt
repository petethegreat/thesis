slide 4 - eta coverage of calorimeters is larger than for previous generation of experiments

slide 5 - L1 Calo does jet triggers, which I will talk about later
	  
slide 7 - had cal - EM scale energy - expect a linear response to EM particles

slide 8 - there are a few things we need to say here

slide 10 - say what athena is - ATLAS sowftware framework used for reconstruction and analysis of data.	  


need to sort out where I first mention the noise subtraction
