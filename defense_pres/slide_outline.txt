TODO

PK - need slide on MC simulation (TB)
   - need slide on trigger.

slides should be ok
make backups on topoclusters, pileup/UE, Dijet results, TB resolution numbers.





screw with slides. Make some backup slides as PK suggested


shit I need to emphasize:

- MC is important. All hadronic calibration derived from MC
- CMS rapidity gap
- Forward region is where I do stuff
- FCal is the new thing in the inclusive measurement


















study
-read generator paper
-read (skim at least) nurse paper
- Mike will ask about QFT
--make sure we know how generators work
--renormalisation - look at thooft stuff, maybe go through qcd running couplking again - WW scattering
--interface between perturbative and non-perturbative 
-- parton showering - leading logs
-- colinear radiation
-- look at scet review?

- check kinematic stuff
- get some idea of where kinematic limit for tevatron was 
- should be able to relate pt and energy in FCal (30?)




Slides PK wants me to add:

- EM+JES
- TB topocluster results
- pp collisions/UE/Minbias




























introduction
Atlas
FCal (in some detail, possibly electronics)

Testbeam
beamline/instrumentiation/setup

cylindrical clustering
double gaussian fit
electrons - pion component

rounding bug should go somewhere
linearity and resolution results

topoclusters?
and cluster moments

Inclusive jets

(focus on trigger)

Inclusive jets ( - all jets) and dijets
kinematic range - first measurement used 17 nb^-1, for jets above (30 GeV?), in rapidity |y| < 2.5
extended this down to include jets with pt above 20 GeV, and into forward region
in total, measuring jets in rapidity range |y| < 4.4 and 20 < pt < TeV
compare to tevatron which did jets in the range 60 GeV - 700 GeV and y < 2.5
and cms, which does inclusive jets in the range |y| < 2.5 and forward jets in the range 3.2 -4.4 (check numbers)

jets 
antikt algorithm
calibration EM+JES

Trigger
