renormalisable - can calculate stuff at energy E without needing to know details on theory at energies above \Lambda.

Renormalizable (superficially) interactions - couplings must have dimension (mass) less than 4. Otherwise couplings blow up at high scales, non perturbative.

quickly look at gauge transformations. Want to (at least roughly) know how fields (fermion/boson) transform.
