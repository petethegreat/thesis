Questions

Pierre:

calorimeter stuff
why parrallel plates in HEC, tile? (sample shower longitudinally?)
hadronic shower resolution sampling? why are more samples better? effects of non compensation - theres stuff on this in Wigmans - does it constribute to stochastic or constant term (to both -but understand how)?
-

- shower moments - he was asking about the energy density plot, and did I understand all the structures present in there. It might be worth looking into this in data/MC. I think agreement is worse in 4L, whereas 2004 TB looked more like 4H(?)

the statement about leading order only being accurate to order of magnitude comes from NLOJetpp.pdf



Jets
- he mentioned unfolding

-Thesis says TeV scale is relevant, but it's rare that TeV gluons are exchanged, TeV jets are rare, so statement in thesis is a little exaggerated.

- jets - specifically ratio plots/powheg. Powheg is supposed to be better (interfaced). using fixed order + non-perturbative is old-school. Fig 5.23. Why powheg + herwig and powheg + perugia so much higher? Powehg x non-perturbative and powheg AUET2B are good. Differences are just nonperturbative soft physics, why is there so much variation?

Mentioned that stuff at LO is only leading order. Justify that. NLO should just bring in corrections at order \alpha/10, this shouldn't be order of magnitude type stuff.

Why renormalizability is good was ok, but could use some work.
